historical bike trips data in Norway for the city of Oslo, Bergen,
and Trondheim directly to R.

To read bike trips data for winter bikes in Oslo, add a capital "W" at
the end of the city name (i.e. "OsloW"). Trip records for winter
bikes are currently only available for Oslo at the time of writing
(2019-03-04).

The data is read from:
