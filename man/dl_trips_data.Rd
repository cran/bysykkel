\code{dl_trips_data} downloads anonymized historical bike trip records in
Norway for the city of Oslo, Bergen, and Trondheim.

To get trip records for winter bikes in each city, add a capital "W" at
the end of the city name (f.ex. "OsloW" for Oslo). Trip records for winter
bikes are currently only available for Oslo at the time of writing
(2019-03-04).
